# You want people who know each other to sit together. 
# But as each person knows only a few of the attendees directly, 
# you want to make it easy for people to get to know each other.

# On each line, there are two names, indicating that the two people are friends
# Two people are introducable if they have a mutual friend.

# Once two people know each other, they can perform more introductions and hence expand the range of people each of them knows.
# A person's friendship group is In the set of people they will eventually know after following all the possible introductions

# Part 1

# The friendships among your guests are listed in 06-friendships.txt. How many friendship groups are there?
# (The file contains exactly one friendship per line. On each line, there are two names, separated by spaces. 
# Names can have non-letters in them, such as "Ella-Louise", but no name contains a space.)

# Code inspired by Wojciech Czubak solution.
